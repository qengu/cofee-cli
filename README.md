## Cofee-CLI

---

I built this CLI program to help me keep track of assignments and due dates.   

### Install
[Link to NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cofee-cli) 

```npm install -g cofee-cli```

### Getting started  

#### Features:  
- View your list of assignments, including due dates and in how long they are due  
- Add & Remove an assignment to the list  
- Edit an assignment

#### Type:
```cofe -h```  

after installation to get started with all the commands.  
The prefix for this CLI is
```cofe```  
and not
```cofee```,
despite the name of the package.
